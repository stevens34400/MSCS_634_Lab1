# MSCS 634 Lab 1 â€“ Data Preparation and Exploration

## Purpose
This lab demonstrates how to apply key data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques using the Iris dataset in Python.

## Key Insights
- Petal length and sepal length show strong species-level separation.
- Outliers were identified and removed using IQR filtering.
- The data was scaled and visualized for better understanding and presentation.

## Dataset Source
The Iris dataset is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

## Files
- `Lab1_Iris_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the lab.
- `iris_dataset.csv`: Dataset used.
